#Set the seed following the format I have given above.
#For instance if you are in group 1 your seed should be 30001,
#if you are in group 12 your seed should be 30012.
#But I set it to 1234 as an example
set.seed(30002)
#Decide which records to keep in the training set. I sort them for the convenience

#Extract the indexes that were not in trainRec to the test records
